Notes of GUI Tyche

The first page shows a list of scenarios. 
Thus we need to read the scenarios and print pictures on the front page.

We might also need to send information regarding the different options available for use. 
While reading the folders from the Tyche tutorial folder, while options might show up, but useful data like photos and description will not show up. Not sure how to include them. 

Do we need to add a text file and a picture file within each folder to populate the GUI?

Categories and Metrics are needing optimization inputs immediately.. That should not be the case. Need to check what the non optimization mode is doing.
