# Background
Understanding the FOA process is essential to designing an effective tool to make to make technically and analytically-based decisions. The "Mock FOA" process takes a service design approach to understanding the FOA-writing process as it stands. The Mock FOA began with interviews with five previous DOE detailees and seven senior DOE staff who have led multiple FOA development efforts. A major theme emerged: effective communication of analysis logic and resultsposes one ofÂ the largest challenges during the FOA process.

A decision-support tool could assist in the communication necessary to percolate this technical information up the chain. Interview findings were formalized in collaboration with the NREL service design team to understand where such a tool could make the greatest impact. The team considered the steps taken to issue a FOA, resources referenced, and decision-makers involved.

## Phases
Interviews revealed that, while all FOA processes are unique and highly non-linear, specific actions must occur. These characterize phases of the FOA journey:
1. **Launch**. Decide to issue a FOA.
2. **Frame**. Formulate a plan to collect the information necessary to write the FOA
3. **Scope**. Investigate topic options.
4. **Draft**. Compile information into draft FOA.
5. **Refine**. Prepare FOA for distribution.
The specific needs of each phase inform the tool **content**.

## Roles
The team considered that different staff members will interact with this information differently and prefer different methods of data communication. These roles were characterized by "personae" defined by level of involvement in the FOA-writing process.
* Technical analyst
* Technical lead
* FOA lead
* Approver

Decision makers in each of these roles will interact with tool output. The tool users determine how the tool will be used and how its content will be displayed, informing **interactions and data visualization**. For example, a user who will view the tool output in a presentation will need a static representation of the tool output.

# Potential topics
Prototyping a tool requires content. The team referenced two previous FOAs to understand the break-down of topic areas. We then extracted FOA topic/subtopic areas and metrics from 2016 budget request, combining hard/soft cost-focused FOAs to examine how to compete the two and avoid directly analyzing a specific past FOA. Following this process further informed the team's understanding of how decision-makers might decide what to input into the tool.

Topics under consideration might be assessed by the following metrics:
* $/W_{DC}
* $/kWh
* Strategic metal content (lifetime)
* Hazardous waste content (lifetime)
* Lifetime
* Reliability
* Emissions
* Labor
<!-- * Diversity of approach -->
