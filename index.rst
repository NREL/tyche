===========================================================================

Risk and uncertainty are core characteristics of research and development (R&D) programs. Attempting to do what has not been done before will sometimes end in failure, just as it will sometimes lead to extraordinary success. The challenge is to identify an optimal mix of R&D investments in pathways that provide the highest returns while reducing the costs of failure. The goal of the R&D Pathway and Portfolio Analysis and Evaluation project is to develop systematic, scalable pathway and portfolio analysis and evaluation methodologies and tools that provide high value to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy (EERE). This work aims to assist analysts and decision makers identify and evaluate, quantify and monitor, manage, document, and communicate energy technology R&D pathway and portfolio risks and benefits. The project-level risks typically considered are technology cost and performance (e.g., efficiency and environmental impact), while the portfolio level risks generally include market factors (e.g., competitiveness and consumer preference).

This documentation summarizes work in progress on R&D Portfolio Analysis and Evaluation. It discusses a mock FOA approach for designing a decision-support process for R&D portfolios, the portfolio-optimization methodology, and the underlying software framework. The end goal of this process is to inform decision-making across R&D projects and programs through identifying and evaluating, quantifying, and monitoring, managing, documenting, and communicating energy technology R&D pathway and portfolio risks and benefits.
