Python API
==========

The ``tyche`` module is a Python package for R&D pathways analysis and
evaluation. It contains five Python classes for R&D pathway decision
support.

-  ``Designs`` for specifying and evaluating technology decisions in the
   presence of uncertainty.
-  ``Investments`` for specifying and evaluating R&D portfolios
   consisting of multiple technology-investment options.
-  ``Evaluator`` for rapidly evaluating the costs and benefits for sets
   of portfolios.
-  ``EpsilonConstraints`` for multi-objective optimization using a
   generalization of the epsilon-constraint technique.
-  ``DecisionGUI`` for interactively exploring the costs and benefits of
   R&D portfolios.
